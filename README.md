# Intro-to-KNN
In this project, I learned how to apply a machine learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), to classify a car based on its attributes. The  Car Evaluation dataset
I used in this project was obtained from the University of California, Irvine in their machine learning repository. The link to the dataset can be found here:

With this algorithm, I was able to attain a prediction accuracy of 93.06%. I was able to attain this accuracy based on looking at attributes such as the number of doors the 
car has, persons capacity in terms of people to carry, lug_boot or the size of the luggage boot, and the estimated safety of the car. To run this program, I recommend uploading
the script onto Google Colab which was the IDE I used to implement the algorithm.
